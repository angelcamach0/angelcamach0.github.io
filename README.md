The Ark Projects

This is a website I created around 2020 to show that I would be a good candidate for a web development job at the time.
It was built to showcase projects I was working on. I now maintain a professional portfolio at:
https://www.angel-camacho.com

Site details
- Static HTML/CSS/JS site based on the Start Bootstrap Agency template.
- Uses Bootstrap 4 and jQuery for layout and interactions.
- Images and assets live under `assets/`, with custom styling in `css/styles.css` and behavior in `js/scripts.js`.
- Contact form is disabled in this repo for safety on static hosting.

Run locally
1) Clone the repo:
   - `git clone https://github.com/angelcamach0/angelcamach0.github.io.git`
2) Serve the site from the repo root:
   - `python3 -m http.server 4269`
3) Open in your browser:
